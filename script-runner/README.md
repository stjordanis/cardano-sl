# script-runner

This module contains scripts to perform tests at the cluster level - running clusters of nodes, issuing update proposals to them, restarting them, etc. Some of the code here was extracted from the `auxx` package and reworked.

### Usage

See the `stack-gui` and `stack-test` scripts which contain usage commands.
